TinyWM in Ada
-------------

This project is an evening experiment to port
Nick Welch's [tinywm](http://incise.org/tinywm.html) from C to Ada. Like the original, it
uses Xlib as its underlying library.

Also like the original, this code can be considered public domain.


Most of the time spent was creating the proper bindings to Xlib in Ada, which
was no fun.
